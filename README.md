- https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1230737/Youve-Got-Spam

The project samples

## Binary Classification:
1) Sentiment detection (Psoitive or Negative) through classification of text and
2) Spam detection (Spam or No Spam) through classification of text.

## Classifications with Multible Classes:
