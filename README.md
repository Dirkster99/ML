# ML
Sample Project for Binary Classification using ML.Net

This project contains "Hello World" machine learning .Net sample projects from these sites:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/sentiment-analysis
- https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1230737/Youve-Got-Spam

and other resources. The projects sample several categories of machine learning tasks with sample
data and working code.

## Binary Classification
[Introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/resources/tasks#binary-classification)

1) Sentiment detection (Psoitive or Negative) through classification of text and
2) Spam detection (Spam or No Spam) through classification of text.

## Classification with Multible Classes
[Introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/resources/tasks#multiclass-classification)

3) Using an input vector of 2 elements [integer and string](https://github.com/Dirkster99/ML/blob/master/source/MultibleClasses/Program.cs)

4) Using an input vector with more than 2 elements [integer and string and multiple integers](https://github.com/Dirkster99/ML/blob/master/source/IrisDataset/Program.cs)
